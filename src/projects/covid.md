This project aims at displaying real-time updates of the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide. The app is built on create-react-app boilerplate code, and calls a publicly available API to display country-wise number of cases while categorising them as infected, recovered and deaths. The app uses chart.js to also display a bar chart for country wise cases and a line chart for global cases. Styled using CSS modules.
