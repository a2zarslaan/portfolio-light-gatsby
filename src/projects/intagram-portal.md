This project focuses on discussing the process and technology used in building an Android compatible Augmented Reality Portal App. The application was developed using Unity Game Development Engine and ARCore and consists of an Augmented Reality Portal which allows the users to walk inside and experience their Instagram pictures in a 3D environment in the form of a room. This application communicates with the Instagram API to get the user’s pictures and display them like paintings on the walls of the virtual room.
