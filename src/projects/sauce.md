Smart Assets for re-Use in Creative Environments, or SAUCE is a three-year EU Research and Innovation project between 9 companies and research institutions to create a step-change in allowing creative industry companies to re-use existing digital assets for future productions. It is backed by European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.

The goal of SAUCE is to produce, pilot and demonstrate a set of professional tools and techniques that reduce the costs for the production of enhanced digital content for the creative industries by increasing the potential for re-purposing and re-use of content as well as providing significantly improved technologies for digital content production and management.

The deliverable includes the development of a Virtual Reality proof of concept to demonstrate the findings of the research conducted by Trinity College Dublin.
