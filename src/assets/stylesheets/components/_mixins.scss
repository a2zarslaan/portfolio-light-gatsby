//media query manager. Accoridng to our lecture titled "Mobile-First vs Desktop-First", we define breakpoint ranges. We're using a desktop first approach here. We can write them down here -
/*
  0-600px       Phone
  600-900px     Tablet Portrait
  900-1200px    Tablet Landscape
  [1200-1800px] This is where our normal styles apply
  1800px+       Big Desktop

  We'll write max-width media queries for the ranges lower than our normal working range and min-width for ranges more than our normal working range 


  $breakpoint argument choices
  - phone
  - tab-port
  - tab-land
  - big-desktop

  ORDER: Base + Typography > General layout (eg header, footer, nav etc.) + Grid > Page layout > Components  

  we'll be using ems for media queries because rems behave weirdly for media queries. 
  1em = 16px
